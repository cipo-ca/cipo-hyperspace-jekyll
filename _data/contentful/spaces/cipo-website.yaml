        value: Plasma is the protein-rich liquid in blood that helps other blood components
          circulate throughout your body. It supports your immune system and helps
          control excessive bleeding, which is why plasma donations are important
          to help treat bleeding disorders, liver diseases and cancer.

          your body is extra-prepared to fight off serious illnesses that your immune
          system alone might not handle very well. If you get the shot that covers
          measles, for instance, it can protect you from getting measles, if you’re

          that supplements are no substitute for a healthy, balanced diet.

          Purell or other gel-based hand sanitizers can be used in situations where soap and water is not readily available.
          A common sense approach to infection prevention is generally the best policy to follow. Individuals with a primary immunodeficiency should avoid exposure to people who have signs of an obvious infection, like people who are coughing, have a fever or have vomiting and/or diarrhea. During periods of influenza outbreaks, it might be wise to avoid crowded areas such as shopping centers and movie theatres. Many PI patients people have questions about flying or other travel. When in doubt, ask the immunologist or primary healthcare provider for advice.

          thing to do to insure good health. Erratic sleep patterns have been shown
          to have negative effects on the immune system

        value: Since vaccines for chicken pox, measles, mumps, smallpox, rubella,
          rotavirus, BCG, yellow fever, oral polio and the influenza nasal spray are
          live attenuated vaccines, individuals with primary immunodeficiency diseases
          could potentially contract infections if they receive these immunizations.
          In practice, infants with Severe Combined Immune Deficiency (SCID) are at
          greatest risk and it is the general recommendation that others with defects
          in adaptive immunity also avoid receiving any live agent vaccines. Since
          some of these live vaccine viruses (oral polio, rotavirus) can be found
          in the some body fluids and stools for up to two weeks following vaccination,
          it may be necessary to limit contact between any recently immunized individual
          and infants with SCID until the period of viral shedding has passed. For
          children and adults with PI who are receiving immunoglobulin (Ig) replacement
          treatment, the infused antibodies should give them adequate protection from
          any secondary spread of vaccine virus.

        value: We recommend that all members of a family, including the patient, should
          keep their immunizations up-to-date. This is particularly important for
          readily communicable diseases like influenza with many different strains
          circulating that change from year to year. This is because some patients
          with a PI may respond and benefit directly from the influenza vaccine. Even
          if they do not, there is little down side to receiving the killed vaccine.
          Family members who are able to respond to a vaccine will be protected. Even
          if the PI patient does not respond to the immunization, they will benefit
          from having everyone else in the home protected from infection and thus
          not susceptible to bringing the virus home with them. This is particularly
          important if there are other school-aged children in the home. We want to
          create a “protective cocoon” of immunized persons surrounding the PI patients
          so that they have less chance of being exposed to a potentially serious
          infection like influenza. CIPO is a proud member of the IFA World Coalition
          on Adult Vaccination.

          The notion that people get sick more often when they are under increased stress is supported by scientific data. Chronic illness, itself, is known to be a major life stressor. Some studies suggest that stress negatively affects the functioning of the immune system. There are also scientific studies that suggest reducing stress can improve immune function. Many stress reducers are easy to incorporate into one’s daily life. These include massage therapy, biofeedback, meditation and hobbies. The importance of physical activity and adequate sleep in helping to reduce stress has already been discussed.
          If you find that you are unable to deal with the stresses in your life, you should absolutely discuss these concerns with your primary care provider. They can assist you or refer you to someone who can help you to minimize and effectively deal with stress. You should never feel that there is nothing that can be done for the stress that you feel is overwhelming and keeps you from living and enjoying your life.
